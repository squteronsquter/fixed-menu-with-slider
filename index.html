      <h1>Tope of the page</h1>
      <p>
        The Nellie, a cruising yawl, swung to her anchor without a flutter of
        the sails, and was at rest. The flood had made, the wind was nearly
        calm, and being bound down the river, the only thing for it was to come
        to and wait for the turn of the tide.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sea-reach of the Thames stretched before us like the beginning of an
        interminable waterway. In the offing the sea and the sky were welded
        together without a joint, and in the luminous space the tanned sails of
        the barges drifting up with the tide seemed to stand still in red
        clusters of canvas sharply peaked, with gleams of varnished sprits. A
        haze rested on the low shores that ran out to sea in vanishing flatness.
        The air was dark above Gravesend, and farther back still seemed
        condensed into a mournful gloom, brooding motionless over the biggest,
        and the greatest, town on earth.
      </p>

        The Director of Companies was our captain and our host. We four
        affectionately watched his back as he stood in the bows looking to
        seaward. On the whole river there was nothing that looked half so
        nautical. He resembled a pilot, which to a seaman is trustworthiness
        personified. It was difficult to realize his work was not out there in
        the luminous estuary, but behind him, within the brooding gloom.

        Between us there was, as I have already said somewhere, the bond of the
        sea. Besides holding our hearts together through long periods of
        separation, it had the effect of making us tolerant of each other’s
        yarns—and even convictions. The Lawyer—the best of old fellows—had,
        because of his many years and many virtues, the only cushion on deck,
        and was lying on the only rug. The Accountant had brought out already a
        box of dominoes, and was toying architecturally with the bones. Marlow
        sat cross-legged right aft, leaning against the mizzen-mast. He had
        sunken cheeks, a yellow complexion, a straight back, an ascetic aspect,
        and, with his arms dropped, the palms of hands outwards, resembled an
        idol. The director, satisfied the anchor had good hold, made his way aft
        and sat down amongst us. We exchanged a few words lazily. Afterwards
        there was silence on board the yacht. For some reason or other we did
        not begin that game of dominoes. We felt meditative, and fit for nothing
        but placid staring. The day was ending in a serenity of still and
        exquisite brilliance. The water shone pacifically; the sky, without a
        speck, was a benign immensity of unstained light; the very mist on the
        Essex marsh was like a gauzy and radiant fabric, hung from the wooded
        rises inland, and draping the low shores in diaphanous folds. Only the
        gloom to the west, brooding over the upper reaches, became more sombre
        every minute, as if angered by the approach of the sun.
